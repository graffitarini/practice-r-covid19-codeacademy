# practice-r-covid19-codeacademy

In this project we will be looking at data associated with the Coronavirus pandemic from 2020. While this topic isn't your typical lighthearted Codecademy assignment, we felt like it is a excellent way to use your new R skills to understand the world around you. This assignment was written on March 23rd, 2020; since you will be taking this assignment in the future, we’re hoping that this can be an interesting historical analysis rather than an ongoing issue.

# Collect and Investigate the Data

We’ve provided three datasets named `corona_confirmed.csv`, `corona_recovered.csv` and `corona_deaths.csv`. For the entirety of this project, we’ll be using these datasets. You can find more recent versions of this data at Johns Hopkins’ data repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19).

This is a good opportunity to practice downloading data from GitHub or other repositories. We’re using files found in the `csse_covid_19_time_series` folder. In addition, we recommend looking at some of the projects linked on the GitHub page that can help give you a better sense of what type of information you can extract from this data.
